My name is Varsha Menon, and I am a rising undergraduate senior at Georgetown University. I am currently majoring in International Political Economy and minoring in French. I will also begin the BSFS/MSFS Accelerated Program in the fall, and I intend on graduating with a Master's degree in Foreign Service in 2022. 
This website is intended to demonstrate major academic projects I've accomplished, as well as any relevant certificates I've received.
